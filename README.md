# Surplo
The SURPLO app is revolutionizing the agriculture sector by providing a comprehensive platform for farmers and enthusiasts alike. With a focus on educating youth about farming practices, the app offers various features to assist farmers in obtaining necessary resources such as manure and water, while also implementing safety measures. Through advanced AI technology, surplus food is repurposed for black soldier fly farming, contributing to waste reduction and resource utilization. Additionally, a subscription plan allows for the collection of food waste, which is converted into valuable manure and sold to those in need. The app integrates industrial symbiosis and digital monitoring solutions to optimize water usage and detect leaks, addressing critical challenges in water management. It also utilizes predictive modeling to forecast wildfires, aiding in early detection and mitigation efforts. Through certification programs, practical training sessions, and expert guidance, the app aims to uplift the agriculture sector and reduce farmer suicides. Serving as a mentor, the app offers assistance with queries and provides multilingual classes on various farming methods. The innovative T-rod feature integrates multiple sensors into a single rod, enabling comprehensive data collection on soil and environmental conditions. This data empowers farmers to make informed decisions, optimize resource utilization, and implement sustainable practices, leading to sector-wide benefits in food security, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.
