# Surplo
Our app Surplo focuses on the agriculture sector, primarily aimed at educating youths about agriculture. It includes numerous features designed to assist farmers in obtaining adequate manure, water, and implementing safety measures. Additionally, a T-rod feature is incorporated to provide farmers with comprehensive data about their land.
This app serves as a mentor throughout the agricultural process, guiding users from preparation to harvest. By providing valuable insights and resources, it empowers farmers to optimize their practices and achieve successful outcomes.

1. EXPIRED FOOD TO MANURE:
The platform uses an AI system to analyze photos and sensor data to assess the quality of food. The AI system then determines an expiry date for the food.
If the food remains unsold within the non-expiry period, it transitions to the expired section of the app. Here, the food is used for black soldier fly farming.
Black soldier fly larvae are used to break down organic waste and produce food and feed for other animals. Black soldier flies are globally farmed insects known for their efficient conversion of waste into valuable resources.

2. SUBSCRIPTION
The food waste is converted into manure and sold through an app to people who need it. The subscription plan has different tiers, and a percentage of the profit from manure sales is shared with the families who provide the food waste. This way, they can earn a monthly income from their food scraps.

Overall, this system helps farmers get manure at a good price, while also reducing waste and promoting recycling.

3. WATER
The system utilizes an image recognition model trained on a large dataset of labeled crop leaf images.
This dataset covers various disease categories and healthy states of crops.
Through deep learning techniques, the model can accurately classify crop leaves, facilitating the rapid identification of fungal, bacterial, viral diseases, and healthy conditions.
Farmers can use the app's mobile interface to capture images of crop leaves. These images are then uploaded for analysis by the app's algorithm.
The algorithm processes the data and applies the trained model to classify the crop disease.
The farmer receives prompt diagnosis results with actionable recommendations and treatment strategies tailored to their specific situation.
This technology allows farmers to quickly identify crop diseases and pests, and take appropriate actions to mitigate these issues. This can help to improve crop health, increase productivity, and minimize the impact of diseases and pests on agricultural yields.

## How it Works ?
1. The project works with reactjs as the frontend and django as the backend. it uses django to fetch data from the database and react is used to show the data in the website. the website has multiple features including tabs for expired food, non expired food, industrial symbiosis, company services, etc.
